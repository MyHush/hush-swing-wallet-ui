To run the HUSH Swing GUI Wallet, you must have Java 1.8+ installed.

To launch, do either of the following:
1. Click on the `HushSwingWalletUI.jar` file directly if your system supports this method of execution
2. Click on `run.bat`, which does the following option for you
3. In a Command Prompt window, from the current directory, type: `start java -jar HUSHSwingWalletUI.jar` (or `javaw` in place of `java` to hide launching window)

If you would prefer not to install Java directly, you may want to look into our bundled release
which includes the runtime locally.
